\value{
An object of the \code{gg} and \code{ggplot} class comparing the theoretical
density function with the base density function. The object shows the
compared density functions, the intersection area between them, and the
value of the area.
}
\description{
Inspect the probability density function used as the base with the theoretical
density function from which observations are desired.
}
\details{
The function \code{\link[=inspect]{inspect()}} returns an object of the \code{gg} and \code{ggplot} class that
compares the probability density of two functions and is not useful for the
discrete case, only for the continuous one. Finding the parameters of the
base distribution that best approximate the theoretical distribution and the
smallest value of \code{c} that can cover the base distribution is a great strategy.
Something important to note is that the plot provides the value of the area of
intersection between the theoretical probability density function we want to
generate observations from and the probability density function used as the
base. It's desirable for this value to be as close to 1 as possible, ideally
\enumerate{
\item When the intersection area between the probability density functions is 1,
it means that the base probability density function passed to the \code{f_base}
argument overlaps the theoretical density function passed to the \code{f} argument.
This is crucial in the acceptance-rejection method.
However, even if you don't use the \code{\link[=inspect]{inspect()}} function to find a suitable
distribution, by finding viable args_base (list of arguments passed to f_base)
and the value of \code{c} so that the intersection area is 1, the \code{\link[=accept_reject]{accept_reject()}}
function already does this for you.
The \code{\link[=inspect]{inspect()}} function is helpful for finding a suitable base distribution,
which increases the probability of acceptance, further reducing computational
cost. Therefore, inspecting is a good practice.
}

If you use the \code{\link[=accept_reject]{accept_reject()}} function, even with parallelism enabled by
specifying \code{parallel = TRUE} in \code{\link[=accept_reject]{accept_reject()}} and find that the generation
time is high for your needs, consider inspecting the base distribution.

\examples{
# Considering c = 1 (default)
inspect(
   f = dweibull,
   f_base = dgamma,
   xlim = c(0,5),
   args_f = list(shape = 2, scale = 1),
   args_f_base = list(shape = 2.1, rate = 2),
   c = 1
)
# Considering c = 1.35.
inspect(
   f = dweibull,
   f_base = dgamma,
   xlim = c(0,5),
   args_f = list(shape = 2, scale = 1),
   args_f_base = list(shape = 2.1, rate = 2),
   c = 1.35
)

# Plotting f equal to f_base. This would be the best-case scenario, which,
# in practice, is unlikely.
inspect(
   f = dgamma,
   f_base = dgamma,
   xlim = c(0,5),
   args_f = list(shape = 2.1, rate = 2),
   args_f_base = list(shape = 2.1, rate = 2),
   c = 1
)
