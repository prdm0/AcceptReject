# It works for any univariate distribution

Although most examples presented on this site and in the function documentation involve densities implemented in R, the `accept_reject()` function is capable of generating samples from any univariate distribution, whether it is in R or not, or even one that has not yet been invented. In other words, as long as you have a density, just write the density and pass it to the `accept_reject()` function.

The [**AcceptReject**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AcceptReject) package is designed to be generic and timeless. Consider, for example, the family of Modified beta distributions, proposed in the paper [Modified beta distributions](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13571-013-0077-0). This is a family of probability distributions, as it is possible to generate various probability density functions through the proposed density generator, whose general density function is defined by:

$$f_X(x) = \frac{\beta^a}{B(a,b)} \times \frac{g(x)G(x)^{a - 1}(1 - G(x))^{b - 1}}{[1 - (1 - \beta)G(x)]^{a + b}},$$ with $x \geq 0$ and $\beta, a, b > 0$, where $g(x)$ is a probability density function, $G(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of $g(x)$, and $B(a,b)$ is the beta function.

The authors present a quantile function in closed form that depends on the quantile of the base distribution, that is, $G^{-1}(u) = x$ is known. But here, this is not the case. We will use the `accept_reject()` function to generate samples from the Modified Beta - $G$ distribution, which is a distribution that is not natively in R and could eventually be implemented by the package user.

![Got the idea?](ok.gif)

The following code implements the density (derived in $x$ from the Modified Beta - $G$), for any $G$. It is important to note that the user could implement it in another way. What matters is that the user has a function that implements the probability density function.

The user could, if desired, implement it directly for a specific $G$, for example, Weibull. Here, it will be implemented for any $G$.

Always remember, the `accept_reject()` function only needs the argument `f` to be a function that implements the probability density function in the continuous case or a probability mass function in the discrete case.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
#| label: modified_beta
#| echo: TRUE
#| eval: TRUE

library(numDeriv)

pdf <- function(x, G, ...){
  numDeriv::grad(
    func = function(x) G(x, ...),
    x = x
  )
}

# Modified Beta Distributions
# Link: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13571-013-0077-0
generator <- function(x, G, a, b, beta, ...){
  g <- pdf(x = x, G = G, ...)
  numerator <- beta^a * g * G(x, ...)^(a - 1) * (1 - G(x, ...))^(b - 1)
  denominator <- beta(a, b) * (1 - (1 - beta) * G(x, ...))^(a + b)
  numerator/denominator
}

# Probability density function - Modified Beta Weibull
pdf_mbw <- function(x, a, b, beta, shape, scale)
  generator(
    x = x,
    G = pweibull,
    a = a,
    b = b,
    beta = beta,
    shape = shape,
    scale = scale
  )

# Checking the value of the integral
integrate(
  f = \(x) pdf_mbw(x, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1),
  lower = 0,
  upper = Inf
)
```

Notice that the `pdf_mbw()` integrates to 1, being a probability density function. Thus, the `generator()` function generates probability density functions from another distribution $G_X(x)$. In the case of the code above, the Weibull cumulative distribution function was assigned to the `generator()` function, which could be any other. Note also that I am deriving numerically so that the user does not need to implement the probability density, which involves a somewhat larger expression.

You need to understand that all the code above is a programming strategy, but if you don't understand it very well, that's okay, you just need to implement the probability density function that needs to generate the observations, in the way you already know how to do. Ok?

Now that we have the probability density function with the Modified Beta Weibull density function - `pdf_mbw()`, let's use the `accept_reject()` function to generate observations of a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables with the Modified Beta Weibull distribution.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
library(AcceptReject)
library(cowplot)

# True parameters
a <- 10.5
b <- 4.2
beta <- 5.9
shape <- 1.5
scale <- 1.7

set.seed(0)
x <- 
  accept_reject(
    n = 1000L,
    f = pdf_mbw,
    args_f = list(a = a, b = b, beta = beta, shape = shape, scale = scale),
    xlim = c(0, 2.5)
  )

# Plots
p1 <- plot(x)
p2 <- qqplot(x)

plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 1L, labels = "AUTO")
```

Did you notice how easy it is to use the [**AcceptReject**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=AcceptReject) package? Just implement the probability density function and pass it to the `accept_reject()` function. It doesn't matter how you implemented it; what matters is that you have the function to pass to the f argument of `accept_reject()`.
